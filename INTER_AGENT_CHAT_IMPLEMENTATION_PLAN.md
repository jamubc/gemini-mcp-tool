# Inter-Agent Chat System Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive implementation plan consolidates expert recommendations from Architecture, Security, QA, and Performance teams into a unified, actionable roadmap for building a robust inter-agent chat system. The plan integrates all technical requirements, security controls, quality standards, and performance optimizations into a coherent development strategy.

## System Overview

The inter-agent chat system enables AI agents to communicate through structured conversations with full persistence, security, and performance guarantees. The system provides four core MCP tools for chat management and implements enterprise-grade security, performance, and quality standards.

## Technical Architecture Integration

### Core Components

**ChatManager Singleton Service**
- Central orchestrator using Dependency Injection for testability
- Manages agent lifecycles, message routing, and tool invocation
- Thread-safe operations with async locking mechanisms
- Memory management with LRU eviction and 30k character truncation

**Data Models**
```typescript
interface AgentIdentity {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  cryptographicKey: string; // Security requirement
}

interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  chatId: string;
  senderId: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  sanitized: boolean; // Security requirement
  auditTrail: AuditEntry[]; // Security requirement
}

interface Chat {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  participants: AgentIdentity[];
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  created: Date;
  lastActivity: Date;
  status: 'active' | 'archived';
}
```

**Persistence Layer**
- SQLite database with pluggable provider architecture
