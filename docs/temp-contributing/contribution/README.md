# Got an Idea? Just Build It! ðŸ’¡

**Focus on your idea, not the GitHub complexity.**

## TL;DR: 3 Commands

```bash
./contribution/setup.sh        # Once
./contribution/branch.sh my-idea
# Build your idea here
./contribution/submit.sh       # Done!
```

## You Have an Idea â†’ We Handle the Rest

**Your job:** Build something awesome  
**Our job:** Git, GitHub, formatting, testing, pull requests

## Templates to Get Started Fast

```bash
./contribution/create.sh
# Choose: new-tool | bug-fix | docs
# Get a template, start coding immediately
```

## Made a Mistake?

```bash
./contribution/undo.sh
# Rollback ???
```

## Never Used GitHub?

Perfect! These tools were built for you. No knowledge required.
